# Booking App Assignment

A **React Native (Expo)** application demonstrating a simple sign-in flow, room selection, and booking confirmation. This project was created as a **class assignment** to practice multi-screen navigation using **React Navigation** and basic state management with React Hooks.

## Overview

- **SignIn Screen**: Enter the username and password (`admin` / `admin`). If the credentials are valid, user is navigated to the Dashboard.
- **Dashboard Screen**: Allows the user to enter a Student ID, Name, Number of People, and pick a room from a list. Then they can **Check Availability** to go to the Booking screen.
- **Booking Screen**: Receives the inputs from the Dashboard and checks availability with a hard-coded rooms data array (capacity, availability). Displays a message whether the booking is confirmed or not.
- **Logout**: A header button on the Dashboard returns the user to the SignIn screen.
